Project 4 Report
      I tested the Huffman project on four strings of text which include the given text that was hard coded, the excerpt from Alice in Wonderland, the excerpt from Moby Dick, and Anna Karenina, which was my choice. The first string of text was reduced from 880 bits to 246 bits, saving 634 bits. This is around 28% of the original, meaning I saved  72%. As for Alice in Wonderland, I reduced the bits from the original 1,309,400 bits to 752,855 bits. This is a reduction of 43. Moby Dick was reduced from 98,816 bits to 54,691 bits, saving 44,125 bits, which was a saving of 45% as the reduced amount is 55% of the original. As for Anna Karenina, the original held 15,874,416 bits. This was reduced to 8,960,438 bits, which means a saving of 44%.
